A fun, interactive game built with Python's Turtle graphics library! This project is inspired by the classic Paper.io game, where the player controls a character that moves around the screen, leaving a trail behind. The goal is to create shapes and explore screen movement, all while avoiding collision with the screen edges.

Features
Trail Drawing: The player character leaves a trail as it moves, creating a unique path on the screen.
Directional Control: Use arrow keys to navigate the player up, down, left, and right.
Collision Detection: Hitting the screen edges triggers a game-over state.
Real-time Movement: Smooth, real-time updates make the game visually appealing and interactive.
